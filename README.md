# File-Recording-Book
This allows you to just simpily save text to a document. This can be used when just making a program that needs to output debugging information to a file.
Dont mind the soviet russian flag in the background ahah, i coded this back in year 9 and this is when my humor was very poor!
All files are outputted to the location of the .exe file. This can be changed by opening a file into a specific predetermined path in the source code. 
The book also allows for pages. I think it goes to 99 if my memory serves me right.
